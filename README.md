Solving N Digit Puzzle using Python

The program implements below search algorithms for solving N Digit Puzzle:

1) Breadthfirst Search Algorithm
2) Depthfirst Search Algorithm
3) Uniformcost Search Algorithm
4) Depth Linmited Search
5) Iterative Deepening Algorithm

This problem is written and tested using Python version 3.5

The initial state is entered to the file named "question.txt".

The first line of question.txt file is showing the dimension of the puzzle.

For example: It can be 3, 4 or 5

The next lines show the rows of each puzzle.

In order to run the program, you should run "main.py" file.

Program will show you the initial state of the puzzle, and will ask you to chose the algorithm you would like to use to
solve the problem.

For depth first search algorithm, I have used both recursion and Stack (LIFO) data structure. Because there is a
recursion limit in the computers we use and it gives error when I use recursion.

If we chose N = 8, then the puzzle becomes well known 8 Digit Puzzle.

Given a 3Ã—3 board with 8 tiles (every tile has one number from 1 to 8) and one empty space. 

The objective is to place the numbers on tiles to match final configuration using the empty space.
